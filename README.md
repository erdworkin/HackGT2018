Friendly Finance -Making banking and financial transactions easy and accessible with voice assistance-

We chose to pursue a project that would promote financial wellness and improve user experience. Because we also wanted to incorporate voice technology, we thought about how we could leverage that to improve accessibility for blind users. Presently, managing finances presents a challenge for disabled, and especially for blindusers, as over-the-phone-customer assistance and help from family or friends are often required for these users to manage accounts.
